# Tulinen Taikina - Webpage

## Overview

This project is a responsive website for "Tulinen Taikina," a pizza restaurant based in Helsinki. The site is built using HTML, Bootstrap 5.3, and custom CSS, and it includes various sections to showcase the restaurant's offerings, location, and contact information. The site is designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly across different devices.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar:** A fixed-top responsive navbar with links to different sections of the page, including Home (Etusivu), Restaurant (Ravintola), Menu, and Contact (Ota yhteytt√§). It also includes a dropdown menu for additional pages, such as Spinners and Images.

- **Carousel:** A Bootstrap-based image carousel on the homepage, featuring various restaurant logos.

- **Restaurant Section:** A descriptive section about the restaurant, including images and information about its location and opening hours.

- **Menu Section:** A showcase of the restaurant's menu items presented in card format, followed by an accordion for additional drinks options like Coffee (Kahvit), Beer (Oluet), and Wine (Viinit).

- **Contact Section:** A table listing the contact details of key personnel, such as names, roles, email addresses, and phone numbers.

- **Dropdown Section:** The navbar includes a dropdown menu titled "Dropdown," which provides links to additional pages like "Spinners" and "Images." These pages can be used to demonstrate additional Bootstrap components or other content as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **Bootstrap 5.3:** For responsive design and built-in components like the navbar, carousel, cards, and table.
- **Custom CSS:** For additional styling, including custom carousel controls and styled images.

## Custom Styles

### Carousel Controls

- The carousel control icons have been customized using SVG images to change the default arrows to red.
- The indicators (dots) are also customized, using yellow for inactive and orange for active states.

### Images

- Images in the restaurant section are styled with rounded corners and specific dimensions to ensure a consistent look.
- The images in the accordion have been styled with different shapes, such as rounded and circular, to add visual interest.

### Text Alignment

- Custom classes ensure that text is aligned properly, especially in sections where text needs to be centered or aligned with images.

## How to Use

1. **Navigation:** Use the fixed navbar to scroll to different sections of the page. The navbar will highlight the active section as you scroll, thanks to Bootstrap's scrollspy feature.
2. **Browse the Carousel:** View different logos and images of the restaurant by navigating through the carousel.
3. **Explore the Menu:** Check out the restaurant's menu, including pizzas and drinks, presented in a clean and easy-to-read format.
4. **Contact Information:** Find contact details for the restaurant's team in the contact section.
5. **Dropdown Menu:** Access additional content by using the dropdown menu in the navbar. This menu includes links to the "Spinners" and "Images" pages, which can be customized to show more examples of Bootstrap components or other relevant content.
